- **Unit Testing:**
  - Test individual functions and methods in isolation.
  - Verify the functionality of the `Download` class and the `PairBuilder` class hierarchy.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Test the interaction between different modules.
  - Ensure proper communication between the `html_extract` module and other existing modules.

- **Error Testing:**
  - Simulate scenarios where the web service is unreachable or the HTML content is malformed.
  - Verify that the application gracefully handles errors.

- **Data Validation:**
  - Validate the extracted data against the expected output.
  - Confirm that the table is correctly parsed, and the data is accurately extracted.
