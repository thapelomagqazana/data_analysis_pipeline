# Data Acquisition Base Application

## Overview

This project implements a Data Acquisition Base Application, focusing on acquiring, processing, and storing data obtained from CSV files. It involves a modular architecture, leveraging Python's capabilities to facilitate effective data extraction and storage.

## Features

- Acquire data from CSV files using a command-line interface.
- Implement a robust extraction mechanism to handle data acquisition from specific CSV formats.
- Generate structured output files from the acquired data.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src`: Contains the source code files.
- `tests`: Holds the testing suites for the application.
- `docs`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `src` directory.
4. Execute `python acquire.py -o quartet Anscombe_quartet_data.csv`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
