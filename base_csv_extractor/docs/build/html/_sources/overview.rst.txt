Overview
========

**Project Name:** Data Acquisition Base Application

**Objective:**
The Data Acquisition Base Application aims to provide a robust foundation for acquiring raw data from various sources, specifically focusing on CSV-formatted files. The project will evolve through different phases, starting with data extraction and restructuring, followed by data cleaning and validation in subsequent iterations.

**Who:**
- **Analysts and Decision-Makers:** Require a reliable tool to gather and preprocess data for in-depth analysis.
- **Developers:** Need a flexible and extensible framework for acquiring data from diverse sources.

**What:**
- Develop a command-line application (CLI) capable of extracting relevant data from CSV files.
- Restructure raw data into a more usable form for downstream analysis.

**When:**
- **Initial Phase (Current):** Focus on data acquisition and restructuring.
- **Subsequent Phases:** Integrate features for data cleaning and validation.

**Where:**
- The application runs from the command line, providing flexibility for manual, automated, or web service-based execution.
- The project's source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/thapelomagqazana/data_analysis_pipeline).

**Why:**
- **Flexibility:** Adapt to changing data sources without assumptions about formats.
- **Automation:** Enable automation through CLI execution or integration into enterprise job scheduling applications.
- **Extensibility:** Reflect and adapt to changes in data sources over time.

Definition of Done
------------------

1. **CSV Data Extraction:**
   - The application effectively extracts relevant data from CSV-formatted files.

2. **Restructuring:**
   - Raw data is restructured into a more usable format for downstream analysis.

3. **Flexibility:**
   - The application is flexible in accommodating changes in data sources without hardcoded assumptions.

4. **CLI Automation:**
   - The CLI application can be manually run, automated, or integrated into other systems.

5. **Extensibility:**
   - The codebase allows for seamless extension to accommodate changes in data sources.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Comprehensive documentation covering usage, architecture, and design decisions.

7. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests and acceptance tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

8. **Version Control:**
   - Source code is version-controlled using Git, hosted on a public repository.

9. **Adherence to Design Principles:**
   - The application follows object-oriented design, SOLID principles, and functional design where appropriate.

10. **Collaboration:**
    - Collaboration tools such as Git and GitHub are used effectively for version control and issue tracking.

This project's success will be measured by its ability to provide a reliable and adaptable foundation for data acquisition, setting the stage for subsequent phases of data processing and analysis.
