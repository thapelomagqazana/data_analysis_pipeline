Application Modules Breakdown
=============================

Introduction
------------

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the modules within the Data Acquisition Base Application and their respective functionalities.

1. Model Module
----------------

The Model Module defines the core data structures utilized throughout the application. This module encompasses classes such as `XYPair` and `SomeOtherStructure`. It centralizes data representation and utility functions for data handling.

2. CSV Extract Module
----------------------

The CSV Extract Module contains the logic for extracting data from CSV files. It consists of:
- `Extract`: This class handles data extraction by implementing various strategies using `PairBuilder` subclasses.
- `PairBuilder`: An abstract class providing a blueprint for diverse strategies to build `RawData` from CSV rows.

3. User Interface (acquire.py)
------------------------------

The `acquire.py` file serves as the user interface, handling interactions with the application. It incorporates command-line interface functionality using the `argparse` library to manage the execution of the application.

Conclusion
-----------

The modular architecture of the Data Acquisition Base Application ensures a clear separation of concerns and distinct functionalities within the system. Each module contributes to the overall application by handling specific responsibilities.
